# Citadel Academy Web

**A Rebuilding Camelot Project**  
_Forked from [Satellite.earth](https://github.com/lovvtide/satellite-web)_

---

## Overview

Citadel Academy is the educational platform and credentialing frontend for sovereign families and communities, built as part of the [Rebuilding Camelot](https://github.com/rebuilding-camelot) initiative. Forked from the robust, open-source [Satellite.earth](https://github.com/lovvtide/satellite-web) Nostr client, Citadel Academy extends these foundations to deliver a secure, family-first learning management system and verifiable credentialing solution.

**Value Proposition:**  
Citadel Academy empowers families and individuals to build, preserve, and prove their knowledge and achievements—securely and independently. We offer free, open-source courses, verifiable digital credentials, and sovereign identity tools so anyone can own their learning journey and legacy, without relying on centralized institutions.
